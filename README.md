# Instant-messenger---server
Server side messenger with GUI

This is my first big project.

It's a server-side program that created a (GUI) chat windows that listen for incoming connection on port 6789 for a maximum of 100 clients. A message once is sent will appear in both SERVER and CLIENT application. The communication (socket) terminates when the message "END" is sent.

The program will terminate the connection and will remain on listening until the GUI is closed.
